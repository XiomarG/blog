I recently bought the 2016 Macbook Pro. When I set up my OpenCV stuff in this new computer, I experienced great difficulty.
Basically I cannot compile the OpenCV2.4.12 library due to lack of **QTKit**. Many answers on the internet regarding this simply doesn't work (maybe they work for OpenCV 3).  
To be clear, I have no problem installing OpenCV 2 with homebrew. Just I cannot build static *.a files from the library.  
Out of no choice, I decided to copy the build folder from my old Air to my new computer. And to archive, I created a git repo for it.

I haven't tried yet. No sure whether this solution works or not.
